# Incident Prediction
## Background
We need to figure out whether each client will have incident next according to the historic dataset. 

The dataset is unbalanced the ratio of positive sample Vs neigative sample is 7/93. Therefore using Anomaly Detection method for doing the classification for this dataset.
## 'CNNLSTM Autoencoder' for Anomaly Detection
### CNN part
Using CNN to reduce the dimension of the time serie from 4D to 3D.
### LSTM Autoencoder part
Taking the 3D dataset which is generated by CNN as input, output the pobability of enconter incident the for each client in each month,
